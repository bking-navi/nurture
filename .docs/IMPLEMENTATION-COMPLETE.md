user = User.find_by(email: 'admin@yourcompany.com')
user.grant_platform_admin!
```

### Create Test Agency

```ruby
rails console

# Create agency
agency = Agency.create!(
  name: "Test Agency",
  street_address: "123 Main St",
  city: "San Francisco",
  state: "CA",
  postal_code: "94102",
  country: "US",
  website_url: "https://testagency.com"
)

# Make user the owner
AgencyMembership.create!(
  user: User.first,
  agency: agency,
  role: 'owner',
  status: 'accepted'
)
```

### Test Agency Invitation Flow

1. **Advertiser invites agency:**
   - Go to `/advertisers/YOUR-SLUG/settings/agencies`
   - Click "Invite Agency"
   - Enter agency owner's email
   - Send invitation

2. **Agency accepts:**
   - Agency owner receives invitation (placeholder email for now)
   - Visit `/agency_invitations/TOKEN/accept`
   - Click "Accept Invitation"

3. **Agency assigns users:**

## Architecture Highlights

### Context System
The application now supports three distinct user contexts:

```ruby
Current.context_type = :platform  # Platform admin view
Current.context_type = :advertiser  # Advertiser dashboard
Current.context_type = :agency  # Agency dashboard
```

### Role Hierarchy

**Platform Level:**
- Platform Admin (superuser)

**Advertiser Level:**
- Owner > Admin > Manager > Viewer

**Agency Level:**
- Owner > Admin > Manager > Viewer

**Client Level (for agencies):**
- Admin > Manager > Viewer

### Data Model

```
