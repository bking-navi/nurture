# Platform Admin & Agency Partners Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented Platform Admin and Agency Partner functionality for the Nurture marketing platform. The system now supports three user types: Platform Admins, Advertisers, and Agencies.

## Phase 1: Platform Admin (✅ COMPLETED)

### What Was Built

#### 1. Platform Role System
- **PlatformRole Concern** (`app/models/concerns/platform_role.rb`)
  - Secure system-wide superuser access
  - Separate from advertiser/agency roles
  - Methods: `platform_admin?`, `grant_platform_admin!`, `revoke_platform_role!`
  - Encrypted `platform_role` column on users table

#### 2. Context Management
- **Enhanced Current Model** (`app/models/current.rb`)
  - Supports three context types: `:platform`, `:advertiser`, `:agency`
  - Methods: `platform_mode?`, `advertiser_mode?`, `agency_mode?`
  - Stores: `user`, `advertiser`, `agency`, `membership`, `context_type`

#### 3. Platform Admin Controllers
- **BaseController** - Authentication and context setting
- **DashboardController** - Stats overview (advertisers, agencies, users counts)
- **AdvertisersController** - View all advertisers and their details
- **AgenciesController** - Placeholder for agency management

#### 4. Routes
```ruby
namespace :platform do
  namespace :admin do
    get 'dashboard'
    resources :advertisers, only: [:index, :show]
    resources :agencies, only: [:index, :show, :new, :create]
  end
end
```

#### 5. Platform Admin Layout
- Dark sidebar navigation
- Stats cards
- Context switcher integration
- Professional UI matching the existing design system

#### 6. Context Switcher Enhancement
- Shows "Platform Admin" option for platform admins
- Integrated into existing advertiser switcher dropdown
- Clear visual distinction with indigo badge

#### 7. Rake Tasks
Created `lib/tasks/platform.rake` with commands:
- `rails platform:grant_admin[email]` - Grant admin access
- `rails platform:revoke_admin[email]` - Revoke admin access
- `rails platform:list_admins` - List all platform admins

### How to Use Platform Admin

**Grant admin access via Rails console:**
```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'admin@example.com')
user.grant_platform_admin!
```

**Or via rake task:**
```bash
rails platform:grant_admin[admin@example.com]
```

**Access:**
1. Log in as a user with platform admin access
2. Open the context switcher dropdown in sidebar
3. Click "Platform Admin" to switch to platform mode
4. View dashboard at `/platform/admin/dashboard`

## Phase 2: Agency Partners (✅ MODELS COMPLETED)

### What Was Built

#### 1. Agency Model
- **Table:** `agencies`
- **Structure:** Identical to Advertiser (name, slug, address, website, settings)
- **Validations:** Same as Advertiser
- **Methods:**
  - `owner` - Returns the agency owner user
  - `address_formatted` - Multi-line formatted address
  - `generate_slug` - Auto-generates unique slug

#### 2. AgencyMembership Model
- **Table:** `agency_memberships`
- **Structure:** Same roles as AdvertiserMembership (owner, admin, manager, viewer)
- **Validations:**
  - Unique user per agency
  - Only one owner per agency
  - Role and status required
- **Methods:**
  - `owner?`, `admin?`, `manager?`, `viewer?`
  - `can_manage_team?`, `can_manage_clients?`

#### 3. AdvertiserAgencyAccess Model
- **Table:** `advertiser_agency_accesses`
- **Purpose:** Links agencies to advertisers they can access
- **Status:** pending, accepted, revoked
- **Features:**
  - Token-based invitations (7-day expiry)
  - Methods: `accept!`, `revoke!`
  - Scopes: `active`, `pending`, `revoked`

#### 4. AgencyClientAssignment Model
- **Table:** `agency_client_assignments`
- **Purpose:** Assigns specific agency users to specific clients
- **Roles:** viewer, manager, admin (at client level)
- **Delegations:** `user`, `advertiser`, `agency`

#### 5. User Model Enhancements
Added methods:
- `owner_of_agency?(agency)` - Check if user owns an agency
- `all_contexts` - Returns all platform/advertiser/agency contexts
- `default_context_after_login` - Determines landing page

#### 6. Advertiser Model Enhancements
Added associations:
- `has_many :advertiser_agency_accesses`
- `has_many :agencies, through: :advertiser_agency_accesses`

## What's Next (Remaining TODOs)

### Phase 2 Continued: Agency Features

#### TODO #10: Agency Invitation Flow
**Advertiser invites agency by owner email:**
- Routes: `advertisers/:slug/agencies`
- Controller: `Advertisers::AgenciesController`
- Form: Enter agency owner's email
- Process:
  1. Find user by email
  2. Verify user owns an agency
  3. Create `AdvertiserAgencyAccess` with status=pending
  4. Send invitation email
  5. Agency owner accepts via token link
  6. Status changes to accepted

#### TODO #11: Agency Dashboard
**Show list of clients:**
- Layout: Similar to advertiser dashboard but for agencies
- Route: `/agencies/:slug/dashboard`
- Controller: `Agencies::DashboardController`
- Shows:
  - All advertisers the agency has access to
  - Filtered by user's client assignments (if not owner/admin)
  - Stats per client
  - Quick actions

#### TODO #12: Agency Client Assignment Interface
**For agency owners/admins:**
- Route: `/agencies/:slug/clients/:access_id/assignments`
- Controller: `Agencies::ClientAssignmentsController`
- Features:
  - List agency members
  - Assign/unassign to specific clients
  - Set role per client (viewer, manager, admin)
  - Bulk assignment options

#### TODO #13: Agency Management in Advertiser Settings
**Advertiser can manage their agencies:**
- Route: `/advertisers/:slug/settings/agencies`
- Controller: `Settings::AgenciesController`
- Features:
  - List all agencies with access
  - View agency details
  - Revoke access (changes status to revoked)
  - See which agency users are assigned

#### TODO #15: Transactional Email Templates
**Loops.so templates needed:**

1. **Agency Client Invitation** (`agency_client_invitation`)
   - Sent when advertiser invites agency
   - Variables: `advertiser_name`, `agency_name`, `invitation_url`, `inviter_name`

2. **Agency User Client Assignment** (`agency_user_client_assignment`)
   - Sent when agency assigns user to client
   - Variables: `client_name`, `agency_name`, `role`, `dashboard_url`, `assigner_name`

## Architecture Decisions Made

### 1. Context Switching
- **Decision:** Path-based routing with session-stored context
- **Why:** No DNS configuration, works in all environments
- **Implementation:** `Current.context_type` tracks current mode

### 2. Platform Admin Security
- **Decision:** Encrypted role column, no UI for granting access
- **Why:** Prevents accidental/malicious privilege escalation
- **Granting:** Only via Rails console or secure rake tasks

### 3. Agency Access Model
- **Decision:** Two-level system (agency access + user assignments)
- **Why:** 
  - Agency gets invited as whole unit
  - Agency owner controls which users see which clients
  - Clean permission boundaries

### 4. Same Roles for Agencies
- **Decision:** Agencies use identical role system to Advertisers
- **Why:** Consistent UX, easier to understand, reusable UI components

### 5. Admin Level Agency Access
- **Decision:** Invited agencies get admin-level access by default
- **Why:** Agencies need full access to manage client campaigns effectively
- **Future:** Could add role selection during invitation

## Database Schema Summary

### New Tables Created
- `agencies` - Agency business entities
- `agency_memberships` - Agency team members
- `advertiser_agency_accesses` - Which agencies can access which advertisers
- `agency_client_assignments` - Which agency users can access which clients

### Modified Tables
- `users` - Added `platform_role` (string, indexed)

### Key Indices
- `agencies.slug` - Unique, for URL routing
- `agency_memberships (user_id, agency_id)` - Unique composite
- `advertiser_agency_accesses (advertiser_id, agency_id)` - Unique composite
- `agency_client_assignments (membership_id, access_id)` - Unique composite
