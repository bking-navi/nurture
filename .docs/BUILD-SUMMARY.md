## 🚀 How to Use

### For Developers

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. **Set up Lob API keys:**
   ```bash
   EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
   # Add lob.test_api_key and lob.live_api_key
   ```

3. **Set up Loops email templates:**
   - Create `campaign_sent` template
   - Create `campaign_failed` template

4. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   rails db:migrate
   ```

5. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

6. **Test it out:**
   - Navigate to `/advertisers/:slug/campaigns`
   - Create a test campaign
   - Add recipients (use your address for testing)
   - Send the campaign!

### For Users

1. Navigate to Campaigns from dashboard
2. Click "Create Campaign"
3. Add recipients (manually or CSV)

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why These Choices?

**1. Store recipients per-campaign (not shared contact list)**
- Simpler for MVP
- No contact sync needed yet
- When Shopify integration comes, we'll add contact_id foreign key

**2. Single template for MVP**
- Faster to launch
- Validates full flow
- Easy to add more templates later

**3. Text fields for JSON in SQLite**
- SQLite doesn't have jsonb
- Rails serialization handles it
- Production PostgreSQL will use jsonb (faster)

**4. Daily status updates (not webhooks)**
- Simpler to implement
- Webhooks planned for post-MVP
- Good enough for MVP

**5. Email notifications via Loops.so**
- Consistent with existing app
- Transactional email infrastructure already set up
- Easy to customize templates

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Batch queries with `.find_each`
- Rate limiting (0.1s delay between API calls)
- Background jobs for sending
- Pagination on lists
- Indexed database columns

### Scalability
- Can handle 1000+ recipient campaigns
- Background processing prevents timeouts
- Cost calculation cached on campaign
- Status updates run daily, not per-request

---

## 🔒 Security

### Implemented
- ✅ Permission checks (manager+ only)
- ✅ Advertiser scoping on all queries
- ✅ API key encryption (Rails credentials)
- ✅ CSRF protection on forms
- ✅ Address validation
- ✅ Input sanitization

### Best Practices
- Never expose Lob API keys in logs
- Validate all addresses before sending
- Confirm before sending (cost display)
- Audit trail (created_by_user_id)

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create campaign
- [ ] Add recipient manually
- [ ] Upload CSV (valid)
- [ ] Upload CSV (invalid - check errors)
- [ ] Select template
- [ ] Calculate cost
- [ ] Send campaign (test mode)
- [ ] Check email notification
- [ ] View sent campaign
- [ ] Check delivery status updates
- [ ] Delete draft campaign
- [ ] Try to delete sent campaign (should fail)
- [ ] Test as viewer role (should not have access)

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Model validations
- Service object methods
- Job execution
- CSV parsing
- Permission checks

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Launch)
1. ✅ Set up Lob test API key
2. ✅ Create Loops email templates
3. ✅ Test complete flow end-to-end
4. ✅ Update existing advertisers' state codes if needed

### Short Term (Week 1-2)
1. Monitor campaign sends
2. Check cost accuracy
3. Verify delivery status updates
4. Get user feedback
